The transition to smart and comfortable workspaces is not just a technological evolution, but a lasting cultural transformation. 
Benefits include increased productivity, employee satisfaction, significant energy savings and positive impacts on employees' physical 
and mental health. In this call to action, businesses and society are encouraged to take these changes on board to remain competitive, 
improve their image and create a working environment that promotes innovation, productivity and the long-term well-being of employees.
System tests were carried out. The first step was to check the temperature sensor. Placed in tanks with a mixture of ice and water, it 
showed 0°C and at room temperature 23°C, which was consistent with the reading of the room thermometer. Heating the sensor caused cooling 
to be switched on, and the heating relay was cooled down. Covering the light sensor activated the lamp control relay for a given value. Of 
course, in a real device, both of these sensors should be far from the light and heat source. After covering the motion sensor, after the 
set time, the relays turned off, and when motion was detected, they automatically resumed operation after 1 minute.
The aim of the work was therefore achieved. In the future, it would be possible to save the settings to 
the EEPROM memory to use the ready-made settings after turning on the power.
